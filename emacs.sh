# Today's Sep. 26, 2014. I got re-started with Emacs.
# Learnt some useful commands: some general commands,
# some for frames, some for
# # file manipulation, and some for code compilation.

# There is so much to learn. I got a little overwhelmed. Gotta organize myself
# and figure out what to do next about Emacs.

# To learn:
# auto comment and uncomment.
# search with regex.
# code compilation with Emacs.
# Aim: effecient to edit C/C++, Perl, Python, Shell. If good, Matlab.

# M-;
# Insert or realign comment on current line; if the region is active, comment or uncomment the region instead
